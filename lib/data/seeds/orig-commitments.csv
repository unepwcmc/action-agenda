The Datan algal reef is perhaps the area’s healthiest in terms of reef structure, coverage, and biodiversity, making it incredibly vital to shield it from suffering the same fate as its surrounding reefs. The Datan algal reef is the largest biotic structure, thus providing its reef-associated species a connection to northern populations in Japan. However, the reef is highly degraded and still unnder threat. It is estimated that about 75% of the reef (the northern region of the reef) has been damaged by industrial pollution in the last 50 years.
