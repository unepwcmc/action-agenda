East Kalimantan Green Growth Program,"East Kalimantan is home to some of the last remaining large, intact primary forests in Indonesia. The province contains vast mineral deposits and tropical forest that are rich in biodiversity and crucial in addressing climate change. It is home to approximately 3.43 million people, including indigenous Dayak and Kutai, as well as an estimated 10% of the world’s wild orangutan. Natural resources are immensely important to the region’s economy, but 30-year legacy of forest loss and degradation caused by unsustainable practices threatens East Kalimantan’s natural wealth and the well-being of its people. 

The East Kalimantan Green Growth Program leverages a jurisdictional approach to reduce deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions, conserve biodiversity, and improve the lives of local communities through multistakeholder partnerships between communities, the private sector, government, universities, and civil society organizations. Through this initiative, The Nature Conservancy aims to reduce deforestation and land conversion, and protect high conservation value areas; expand science-based and tested solutions for a more sustainable logging practices, oil palm development and shrimp farming; create markets for sustainably produced commodities and leverage community enterprises to improve livelihoods; enhance village governance and natural resources management; and support government initiatives and policies that help manage forests sustainably and address climate change.",Indonesia,0.538659,116.419388,"386,000 ha",2016,2017,,In progress,Non-profit organisation,,,Sustainable use; Biodiversity conservation; Equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources; Climate change adaptation or mitigation,Protection of land/water; Management of land/water; Education or awareness-raising,Agriculture or aquaculture; Energy production or mining; Biological resource use,https://www.walmartsustainabilityhub.com/media-library/document/nature-project-pipeline/_proxyDocument?id=0000017c-5229-d986-ad7e-5f2da1dc0000; https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/TNC_Natural_Climate_Solutions_INDONESIA.pdf,,live,csv,true
Latin American Regenerative Ranching & Agriculture (R2A),"In Latin America, farming and ranching practices currently consume 70% of freshwater resources and cause 70% of the region's habitat conversion. Nearly half of Latin America's total land area has some level of degradation, and deforestation is now three times the global rate, making agriculture Latin America's leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Conventional agricultural practices, in search of expansion and high yield, have damaged the natural capital on which the region's agricultural success depends, jeopardizing its exceptional potential to continue contributing to world food production.

The Latin America Regenerative Ranching and Agriculture (R2A) strategy exists to transition industry, government, and local producers and associations to a regenerative ranching and agriculture model that incorporates nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation at its core. Current effective projects have been based in Chiapas, Guatemala, Colombia, Brazil and Gran Chaco. 

In the Mexican state of Chiapas which holds about 30% of the country’s freshwater resources, the expansion of livestock and dairy production is accelerating land degradation and desertification. With the incorporation of R2A sustainable practices in dairy farming over 30,000 hectares, milk production has increased by up to 45%. Methane emissions were reduced by almost one third and 8,000 hectares of forests were protected from deforestation. 

Guatemala is Central America’s most diverse country. Poverty rates and chronic malnutrition are one of the highest in Latin America, representing 76% and 67% of the population, respectively. About 50% of Guatemala’s agricultural exports come from the Western Highlands of Guatemala, which is home to many indigenous communities. With the increasing severity of droughts, deforestation and soil loss, food and water security for over the 275,000 small-scale subsistence farmers in this region are in serious jeopardy. TNC is implementing R2A in this region with diverse partners to create a multi-sector compact that will transition the region to a climate resilient agricultural approach through three key pillars: policy strengthening and implementation; local and regional value chain linkages; and territorial landscape management planning. 

The Llanos Action Landscape covers the savanna biome in Colombia. In addition to dominating land use in the Llanos, conventional ranching covers on third of Colombian territory and is contributing to serious soil degradation. Through the R2A approach and collaboration between ranchers, the Sustainable Ranching project has transformed more sustainable ranching practices in more than 42,00 hectares of farmland, helping to eliminate 1.6 tons of CO2.

In recent decades, the Cerrado biome in Brazil has been the center of the greatest agribusiness boom in the world, sourcing one-third of total soybean production to global markets. Soybean production in Brazil tripled between 2001-2017, which equates to 9.6 million hectares of soybean expansion. Such unprecedented growth has come at an enormous environmental cost. TNC in Brazil is working with local stakeholders and agribusiness to integrate the value of sustainable practices into supply chains. 

In the Argentine territory of the Gran Chaco, soybean agriculture accounts for half grain production and over half of the cropped area. Currently, TNC, partners, and local allies protect about 500,000 hectares of land through a collaboration platform to minimize habitat loss and deforestation in agriculture and ranching sectors. The specific focus of R2A, in the Gran Chaco will be targeting the two largest drivers of land change: soy farming and cattle ranching.",Argentina; Brazil; Colombia; Guatemala; Mexico,,,"580,000 ha",2018,2018,,In progress,Non-profit organisation,,,Sustainable use; Biodiversity conservation; Equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources; Restoration; Climate change adaptation or mitigation,Protection of land/water; Management of land/water,Agriculture or aquaculture; Climate change or severe weather,https://www.walmartsustainabilityhub.com/media-library/document/nature-project-pipeline/_proxyDocument?id=0000017c-5229-d986-ad7e-5f2da1dc0000; https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/latin-america/r2astrategypresentation.pdf;  https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/486d482984b442858bd2c2c5983ce940;  The Sustainable Ranching project: https://www.fedegan.org.co/programas/ganaderia-colombiana-sostenible,,live,csv,true
South Africa's Strategic Water Source Areas Program,"South Africa’s Strategic Water Source Areas (SWSA) produce over 50% of the surface water available in the country. These areas are critical given that South Africa is one of the 30 most water scarce countries in the world. WWF is mobilizing Water Source Partnerships: community-public-private partnerships to bring together the interests, actions and mandates of those connected to a local water source area. Promoting the protection of water source areas in policy and long-term planning. WWF already have projects on the go in ten of the 22 water source areas. One project has cleared more than 900 hectares of alien trees in the Outeniqua mountains near George, creating over 28,000 days of local employment and releasing more than 1 billion litres annually back into the natural water system. Work has been carried out with the Department of Water and Sanitation, the Water Research Commission (WRC), the CSIR and the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) to ensure that the strategic importance of South Africa’s water source areas has been recognized in the National Water and Sanitation Master Plan. 

Water Source Partnerships aim to address the root cause of our water crisis: the crisis of water governance. We need more effective stewardship of water source areas to protect the integrity of this critical ecological infrastructure and to ensure water and jobs downstream. To reduce risks to the quantity and quality of water yields, it is essential to improve the management of water and land. This means improving the management practice of all the activities that happen here: forestry, agriculture, mining and settlements. As well as driving the clearing of invasive alien species and replanting of waterwise indigenous species. Effective partnerships are needed to mobilize the different mandates, common interests and intent of actors in critical catchments and WWF is doing this with multiple corporate, NGO and local government partners in each Water Source Area that WWF is working in.",South Africa,,,,2013,2013,,In progress,Non-profit organisation,,,Sustainable use; Biodiversity conservation; Equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources; Restoration; Climate change adaptation or mitigation,Management of land/water; Species management; Education or awareness-raising,"Agriculture or aquaculture; Biological resource use; Energy production or mining; Invasive species, genetic threats, disease threats; Natural system modifications; Residential or commercial development",https://www.walmartsustainabilityhub.com/media-library/document/nature-project-pipeline/_proxyDocument?id=0000017c-5229-d986-ad7e-5f2da1dc0000;https://www.wwf.org.za/our_work/initiatives/water_source_areas/;https://wwfafrica.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_water_source_partnerships_web_pdf_2019.pdf,,live,csv,true
"Establishing Grasslands National Park, South Africa","The initiative’s landscape-level goal is the establishment of the Grasslands National Park – a unique protected area of global importance, located in the Eastern Cape mountains. The project is a collaboration between SANParks and the World Wildlife Fund, and aims to raise significant government funding for the restoration and maintenance of the landscape for water security and creating jobs in alien plant clearing and wetland restoration.

WWF-South Africa has been mandated by a range of Government partners to co-ordinate a process that will result in the largest dedicated Grassland Protected Area ever established in southern Africa and will contribute substantially towards securing significant portions of South Africa’s Strategic Water Source Areas. The area is rich in biodiversity and as a result has been identified as critical for South Africa’s revised National Protected Area Expansion Strategy.

According to SANPARKS Acting CEO, Dr Luthando Dziba, the proposed NE Cape Grasslands National Park will take a somewhat different form to traditional parks, in that the landowners will have the opportunity, through stewardship, to incorporate their land in the park on a voluntary basis. As such they also stand to benefit from a range of financial incentives for private and communal land that is formally protected.",South Africa,-32.29684,26.419389,"30,000 ha",2021,2021,,Committed,Non-profit organisation,,,Sustainable use; Biodiversity conservation; Equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources; Restoration,Protection of land/water; Management of land/water; Species management,Agriculture or aquaculture; Natural systems modifications,https://www.walmartsustainabilityhub.com/media-library/document/nature-project-pipeline/_proxyDocument?id=0000017c-5229-d986-ad7e-5f2da1dc0000; https://www.wwf.org.za/?36082/National-park-with-a-difference-planned-for-Eastern-Cape-grasslands; https://mg.co.za/environment/2021-11-26-south-africas-newest-national-park-will-be-in-an-agricultural-landscape/; https://www.sapeople.com/2021/09/02/south-africa-is-getting-an-exciting-new-national-park-in-the-eastern-cape/,,live,csv,true
"Produce, Conserve and Include (PCI) Strategy","In 2015, Mato Grosso launched the Produce, Conserve, Include strategy (PCI) to support sustainable and inclusive economic growth from 2015 to 2030. The strategy’s ambitious goals aim to conserve natural vegetation, enhance productivity and increase the inclusion of smallholders and indigenous people. This state is the country’s largest agricultural producing region, which means it can have a big impact. Achieving these goals could avoid over 6 gigatons of emissions by 2030 while proving that strong economic growth and thriving forests are complementary. 

PCI is among the world’s leading large-scale jurisdictional initiatives, and brings together civil society, producers, government and increasingly, the private sector, to support the implementation of the PCI. 

In 2019, the PCI entered a new phase with the creation of the PCI Institute, an independent non-profit institution appointed by Mato Grosso government as its official vehicle to enable multi-stakeholder coordination, advise on public policies and measures, lead fundraising efforts, manage and monitor PCI programs. 

Opportunities currently envisioned by PCI stakeholders are, among others: (i) To attract investments and partnerships;(ii) to connect public and private initiatives; (iii) to help ensure a low-risk environment for business; (iv) to leverage new business in the jurisdiction; (v) to help the expansion of markets and improve the image on the international scene; (vi) to test new economic incentives and financial mechanisms and (vii) to test innovative and low carbon business models on the ground including cattle intensification, good agricultural practices, deforestation reduction and forest restoration. 

Mato Grosso’s ambitious goals PCI mobilized several partners such as the Sustainable Trade Initiative – IDH, the World Bank, United Nations agencies and the German Cooperation. Others include the British Government with the REDD Early Movers – REM Program, whose main objective is to support actors who took risks and implemented pioneering actions to reduce deforestation and climate mitigation.",Brazil,,,,2015,2015,,In progress,Non-profit organisation,,,Sustainable use; Biodiversity conservation; Equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources; Restoration,Protection of land/water; Management of land/water,Agriculture or aquaculture; Biological resource use,https://www.walmartsustainabilityhub.com/media-library/document/nature-project-pipeline/_proxyDocument?id=0000017c-5229-d986-ad7e-5f2da1dc0000; https://business.edf.org/insights/mato-grosso-produce-conserve-include-pci/; https://supplychain.edf.org/resources/produce-conserve-include-pci-pitchbook-video/; http://blogs.edf.org/biz/files/2019/05/PCI-PitchBook-final-online.pdf?_gl=1*1ke1ru0*_ga*MTk5NTg3NTI4Ny4xNjUwMzc4MDU5*_ga_2B3856Y9QW*MTY1MDM3ODA1OS4xLjEuMTY1MDM3ODQxNS4zNg..*_ga_WE3BPRQKW0*MTY1MDM3ODA1OS4xLjEuMTY1MDM3ODQxNS4zNg..*_ga_Q5CTTQBJD8*MTY1MDM3ODA1OS4xLjEuMTY1MDM3ODQxNS4zNg..,,live,csv,true
Wildlife Connect,"Wildlife Connect is an exciting initiative of WWF, and the Centre for Large Landscape Conservation is advising on its development. The partnership aims to create ecologically connected and thus climate-resilient landscapes by stopping habitat fragmentation, ensuring production lands enable wildlife flows, improving land-use planning, creating wildlife corridors, and mitigating barriers to wildlife movements such as infrastructure. 

Wildlife Connect has four demonstration landscapes that will be a focus of innovation, implementation, and learning: Pantanal Chaco, Southern Kenya and Northern Tanzania, Central India, and the Carpathian Bioregion (stretching across Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine). 

The Pantanal Chaco initiative aims to protect, manage, and restore ecological connectivity in the Pantanal-Chaco Landscape (PACHA). The transboundary area covers four countries: Argentina (Salta, Santiago del Estero, Chaco and Formosa provinces), Bolivia (Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca and Tarija departments), Brazil (Matto Groso and Matto Grosso do Sur states), and Paraguay (Presidente Hayes, Boquerón and Alto Paraguay departments). The PACHA landscape is one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet, but with industrial scale soybean and cattle production, the region is experiencing some of the highest rates of fragmentation and land conversion in the world. PACHA contains several critical jaguar conservation units and many of the continent’s critical jaguar corridors, the majority of which are categorised as ‘of concern’. To survive as a healthy ecosystem, it is critical that this threatened landscape identifies key areas of ecological connectivity and implements strategies to maintain corridors and protect the flow of wildlife and processes across the landscape. The focus of the PACHA landscape is to reduce habitat loss and fragmentation and maintain ecological connectivity. 

The Southern Kenya and Northern Tanzania initiative aims to link over 40 national parks, forest reserves and community conservation areas across Southern Kenya and Northern Tanzania (SOKNOT). The SOKNOT landscape includes some of the most renowned wildlife havens on Earth including the Serengeti, and one of the world’s most famous migrations – the great wildebeest migration. Most of the iconic wildlife populations found are living outside of protected areas, and wildlife corridors, the beating heart of the landscape, are under threat from land conversion, fencing, infrastructure and climate change. The focus of the SOKNOT landscape is to secure a viable future for the ecosystems and wildlife, and the environmental services provided to hundreds of communities.

Southern Kenya-Northern Tanzania (SOKNOT-UNGANISHA) Transboundary Program,"WWF-Kenya and WWF-Tanzania Country Offices are in the early stages of co-creating an ambitious transboundary conservation programme along the Southern Kenya-Northern Tanzania (SOKNOT-UNGANISHA) landscape.

The programme which will be undertaken in an integrated landscape approach; seeks to contribute to the two Government's efforts to implement their respective wildlife corridor and dispersal area strategies while ensuring that the livelihoods and well-being of people living within those wildlife areas are enhanced. The SOKNOT-UNGANISHA transboundary conservation area broadly covers the following three ecosystems: Mara-Serengeti; Amboseli-West Kilimanjaro and Tsavo-Mkomazi and the areas that connect them. The vision is currently defined as “By 2030, the SOKNOT transboundary landscape forms a connected network of protected areas, including core wildlife dispersal areas and functional corridors; with the resultant ecosystem services underpinning community livelihoods and sustainable development in Kenya and Tanzania”.

This landscape with its richness in both biodiversity and abundance is of global importance with the Ngorongoro crater, important biospheres and bird habitats including World Heritage Sites (WHS), Biosphere reserves, Ramsar sites and home to the Seventh Wonder of the world - the largest annual land mammal migration of over 1.3 million wildebeests and zebras between Tanzania and Kenya. In a nutshell, the landscape is home to millions of wild animals including threatened and endangered species. It is also rich in transboundary river systems on which wildlife depends including the Mau - Mara river basin, the south Ewaso Ng’iro basin as well as the Pangani river basin amongst others.

With a focus on securing the connectivity of critical wildlife migration corridors, the program has adopted a multi-sectoral approach addressing needs for conservation and sustainable resource management in the wildlife, forestry, agriculture, water and livestock sectors.

Lower Fraser River Basin Restoration,"British Columbia is home to some of the world’s most productive salmon rivers. It has a diverse landscape from forests that act as massive carbon sinks to important industries such as agriculture. In the Lower Fraser basin, WWF is working with partners on developing and executing a regional restoration plan, driven by Indigenous priorities. The goal of this work is to restore natural flows, regenerate salmon and wildlife habitat, increase carbon sequestration potential and restore ecological resilience. Throughout, WWF will be working with its Indigenous partners to identify and develop community benefits for their members, including potential employment opportunities. The ongoing and future restoration work is making significant progress towards these goals. 

To date, WWF have designed and are executing a 10-year restoration vision with Katzie First Nation to support ecosystems for wildlife and people in the Lower Fraser watershed. Now, WWF is expanding its impact throughout the Lower Fraser by building and chairing a coalition of organizations working on restoration in the watershed known as the Lower Fraser and Estuary Restoration Coalition (LFER). Members of LFER were brought together for this initiative based on their reputation and track record for collaboration with all levels of government, First Nations, academia, and other NGOs to meet a diversity of stakeholder objectives and multiple values in restoration efforts.

Empowering Community-based Landscape Restoration in Nahuelbuta,"Restoration actions planned with local communities include recovering key ecosystem services, generating new employment and social capital, and strengthening and adding value to existing activities such as tourism and non-timber forest product collection. Objectives of the initiative include the restoration of at least 7,000 ha of native ecosystems and improving sustainable livelihoods of at least 100 families by 2030.

The initiative began in 2014 with community engagement and design. In 2018, funding was obtained to begin a more active implementation, which includes landscape Planning for restoration and cross-cutting participation. This process is aligned with national climate change commitments and the national goal of restoring 1 million hectares of landscapes by 2030. However, further resources are needed to continue carrying out restoration activities. Current pilot restoration sites and engagement with community conservation enterprises demonstrate the necessity, raise awareness of the problems in the landscape and motivate additional interventions. Work over the next three years (2022-2024) will scale up activities, capitalize on experiences, strengthen established multi-stakeholder governance and unlock public and private resources for restoration and community development. 

The initiative is based in an area Chile with an important deficit of services, high unemployment, a low Human Development Index score and a history of deforestation, land degradation and land tenure problems. Limited and precarious employment opportunities in the region center on unskilled seasonal jobs with pulp and paper companies and artisanal fisheries with depleted stocks. This initiative is designed to address this multi-dimensional poverty of the people and natural resources.

Jurisdictional Traceability and Monitoring to Conserve Wildlife Corridors in Central Kalimantan,"A 2017 study by WWF and BKSDA (Balai Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam, the Indonesian Nature Conservation Agency) reported a population of about 5,000 orangutans in Sebangau National Park (SNP). This is largest orangutan population ever studied in the protected areas of Kalimantan. Although WWF does not have data of the population in the corridor between SNP and Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park (BBBNP), they predict it is also substantial.

Climate change threatens the existence of orangutans in SNP because of changes to the park’s ecosystem, the impacts of prolong peat fires (mostly outside the park), and growth patterns of trees that produce fruit/leaves used by orangutans for food. The corridor between the two parks is managed by various parties and consists of multiple land uses, including Government Forest Management Units (KPH), forest plantations, natural forest concessions, community forests, industrial and smallholder oil palm plantations, and other commodity plantations (mainly rattan and coffee). In 2020, WWF conducted a rapid assessment which concluded that several areas with forest cover in the corridor remain suitable habitat for orangutans. 

WWF’s conservation corridor management initiative is carried out through a jurisdictional approach that aims to develop strong partnerships between actors to realize a vision of ecosystem resilience to the impacts of climate change. This vision will be implemented by taking collective action to avoid deforestation, maintaining and increasing the orangutan population, improving community livelihoods, and connecting fragmented forest area and High Conservation Value (HCV) area that provide suitable habitat for orangutans and other biodiversity. Disturbances (such as encroachment) and changes of forest cover in the corridor will be monitored through an early warning system and tools being developed by WWF based on satellite monitoring and GIS analysis. 

The target landscape is the 983,873 ha corridor connecting the peat lowlands of SNP and the highlands of BBBBNP.

Grafton Forest Conservation Project,"The Grafton Forest Conservation Project, a vital section in Western Main, has permanently conserved 21,300 acres that promotes sustainable forest management, maintains important multi-use recreational trails, and improves public access to some of the state’s best recreational areas.

The results come from several years of working with Wagner Forest Management, the state Bureau of Parks and Lands, and many groups in the Bethel, Maine region. The Forest Society of Maine (FSM) now holds a conservation easement on 6070 hectares of sustainable managed forests, and Northeast Wilderness Trust (NEWT) now owns 2446 hectares of critical watershed and high evaluation habitat to be passively managed as wilderness. 

Together these lands fill what had been an unprotected gap in a conservation corridor and connect hundreds of thousands of acres in the western Main mountains to New Hampshire conservation lands. Project success protects these lands, which are rated highly for their resiliency to climate change, from conversion to non-forest uses in an area experiencing strong development pressures.",United States of America,46.83072,-77.044557,"8,620 ha",2020,2020,,Fully implemented,Non-profit organisation,,,Sustainable use; Biodiversity conservation; Equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources; Restoration; Recreation,Protection of land/water; Management of land/water,Residential or commercial development; Agriculture or aquaculture; Biological resource use; Human intrusions and disturbance,https://thecopernicusproject.org/2022/03/21000-acres-of-western-maine-forest-now-under-conservation/; https://newildernesstrust.org/western-maine-conservation-corridor-conserved/; https://appalachiantrail.org/news/grafton-forest-at-landscape-protected/,,live,csv,true
The Frank and Joan Randall Tehachapi Preserve,"The Nature Conservancy (TNC) announced the creation of its largest nature preserve in California, a 29,000 hectare area in the Southern Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains, made possible by a transformative $50 million philanthropic gift by Frank and Joan Randall. This area is one of the most significant in North America because by connecting Northern and Southern California it helps complete an intact network of open space lands from Canada to Mexico. Its unique topography, and its location at the convergence of four diverse ecoregions (Sierra Nevada, Mojave Desert, the Central Valley, and South Coast) only add to its significance in protecting biodiversity in the western US.

The preserve will serve to protect a crucial wildlife corridor and biodiversity hotspot. Land fragmentation and habitat loss caused by highways and development is one of the most serious threats to wildlife in California. Along with climate change, these forces are compacting and altering species’ ranges. By ensuring a critical linkage between Northern and Southern California, the Frank and Joan Randall Preserve will allow rare, threatened, and endangered species to move and adapt to a changing environment. 

The Tehachapi wildlife corridor is also higher in elevation than surrounding areas, which makes it more climate-resilient and thus an important ecological area in the face of climate change. The area’s savanna and forests range in elevation from 800 to nearly 8,000 feet. Unique pockets of cooler habitats known as “sky islands” amass above the area’s hillsides and provide shelter for species that need cool weather like Jeffrey pine and white fir. 

This area of the Tehachapi’s has been called a “crucible of evolution” and is a critically important conservation landscape in a chain of protected and unprotected lands that run from the Sierra Nevada to the Baja Peninsula. The protection of this immense area ensures that 28 sensitive species across California, including slender salamanders, condors, legless lizards, golden eagles, primrose sphinx moths, mountain lions, badgers, and several endangered plants and blue oak trees, have the best chance of survival.

TNC’s vision is to design and establish a system of resilient wildlife connectivity hubs to allow species to move up and down the state and across elevations. In the coming months, TNC Conservancy will proceed with a full assessment of the land to learn more about what steps they will need to take to address the effects of climate change through ongoing conservation, transforming the preserve into a living laboratory where researchers can develop the tools to help nature adapt and persist. TNC will then embark on a multi-year planning process to understand all that is contained on the 29,000 hectares as well as how to unite nine separate ranches with active cattle operations into one preserve while shaping its long-term use and management.",United States of America,35.207121,-118.532606,"29,137 ha",2021,2021,,In progress,Non-profit organisation,,,Biodiversity conservation; Restoration; Climate change adaptation or mitigation,Protection of land/water; Management of land/water,Residential or commercial development; Transportation or service corridors; Climate change or severe weather,https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/randall-preserve/; https://www.nature.org/en-us/newsroom/randall-preserve-california/,,live,csv,true
Coburn Gore Forest Project,"The Forest Society of Maine (FSM) has a long-standing relationship with a family forestland owner in western Maine who is ready to put their land into a working forest conservation easement. The Coburn Gore Forest project, roughly 3358 hectares of well stocked forestland, will be conserved along with one completely undeveloped pond (Crosby Pond) and one pond with very minimal development (Arnold Pond). Both of these waters, along with other wetlands in the area contain excellent heritage brook trout habitat. 

The project lands are located in a highly strategic location given their adjacency to Quebec, the existence of a state road (Route 27), and a border crossing facility proximate to the project lands. These lands have been targeted for transportation and energy related infrastructure over the years and although none have yet come to fruition, these proposals illustrate that the project lands are susceptible to potential development. Additional development pressure comes from the threat of second homes along scenic Route 27 for people who recreate in the area or who frequent Sugarloaf Mountain ski resort, located nearby. The project easement would permanently prohibit development, transmission lines, and mining.

The Coburn Gore area has exceptional conservation values that encompass several important ecosystems. They contain well-managed forests, including late-successional stands; several ponds; rare plants such as Swamp Fly-Honeysuckle; a series of unique wetlands and bogs; and two state-designated Heritage Fish waters. Additionally, a no-harvest reserve is proposed that will encompass hundreds of acres of state mapped Inland Wading Bird and Waterfowl Habitat. The property provides habitat for countless species such as moose, white-tailed deer, black bear, Canada lynx, and several bat species.

There are few opportunities in the Northeast to permanently conserve a tract of forestland such as presented by the 8,300-acre Coburn Gore Forest project. Conserving the Coburn Gore forestlands will fill a critical gap—connecting Maine conserved lands to Crown lands and Nature Conservancy Canada lands in Quebec.

Schoodic Peninsula Project,"Maine Coast Heritage Trust (MCHT) have finalised a deal to secure the protection of roughly 687 hectares of forestland – the so called “Schoodic Forest” – on the Schoodic Peninsula in Winter Harbour. The parcel’s protection marks a big step in conserving a largely intact wildlife corridor that stretches from the ocean to inland forest – one of the last of its kind on the Eastern Seaboard – and offers opportunities for research, education, and recreation. 

MCHT will manage the land with scientific assistance from the Schoodic Institute. Both organisations are planning to work with community members to ensure public access to the property. The projects primary goals are to maintain the mostly forested land as wild habitat, and to support research and educational opportunities. Conservation of this area will also allow for range shifts in plant life, which is critical to keeping ecosystems healthy and making Maine more resilient to climate change impacts.",United States of America,,,688 ha,2021,2021,,In progress,Non-profit organisation,,,Biodiversity conservation; Equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources; Restoration; Climate change adaptation or mitigation; Recreation; Academic research,Protection of land/water; Management of land/water,Biological resource use; Human intrusions and disturbance,https://www.mcht.org/release/maine-coast-heritage-trust-announces-conservation-of-1700-acres-on-schoodic-peninsula/; https://www.mainepublic.org/environment-and-outdoors/2021-12-20/maine-coast-heritage-trust-conserves-1-700-acres-on-schoodic-peninsula,,live,csv,true
