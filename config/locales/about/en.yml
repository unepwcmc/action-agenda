    hero: "Commitments for Nature is a platform that records conservation efforts from all around the world. 
          These commitments can be big or small, but they are designed to inspire action"
    
    body: "The platform draws attention to the role that civil society such as local authorities, 
          Indigenous peoples, and local communities, can play in achieving global ambitions for the 
          conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. It aims to recognize and encourage commitments 
          to conserve areas of land and water. Examples of commitments include actions to protect, 
          sustainably manage and restore nature in a given area of land or sea rather than building on it 
          or deciding to improve the way an area is managed to maximise benefits for both human well-being 
          and the species that live there."

            Sharm El-Sheikh to Kunming Action Agenda for Nature and People. Through the Action Agenda, 
            Governments agreed to encourage non-state actors to develop biodiversity commitments that would 
            contribute towards putting biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030. The platform will 
            continue to raise public awareness and inspire others to safeguard, restore and invest in nature."
      
      right: "The Commitments for Nature platform will complement and support the Action Agenda by working 
              with it in tandem, and displaying the progress being made towards different commitments. 
              With the help of the platform, non-state actors can exchange lessons learned, celebrate success 
              and inspire each other. Commitments for Nature will provide an opportunity to facilitate 
              partnerships and collaboration, as well as test innovative approaches to conservation."
