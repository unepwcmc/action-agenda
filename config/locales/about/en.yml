    hero: "Area-based Commitments is a platform that records conservation efforts from all around the world. 
          These commitments can be big or small, but they are designed to inspire action"
    
    body: "The platform draws attention to the role that civil society such as local authorities, 
          Indigenous peoples, and local communities, can play in achieving global ambitions for the 
          conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. It aims to recognize and encourage commitments 
          to conserve areas of land and water. Examples of commitments include actions to protect, 
          sustainably manage and restore nature in a given area of land or sea rather than building on it 
          or deciding to improve the way an area is managed to maximise benefits for both human well-being 
          and the species that live there."

      left: In 2018, the governments of Egypt and China, with support from the CBD Secretariat, launched the
            Sharm El-Sheikh to Kunming Action Agenda for Nature and People. Through the Action Agenda,
            Governments agreed to encourage non-state actors to develop biodiversity commitments that would
            contribute towards putting biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030. The platform will
            continue to raise public awareness and inspire others to safeguard, restore and invest in nature.
            The Area-based Commitments platform will complement and support the
            <a href='https://www.cbd.int/action-agenda/contribute/' target='blank'>Action Agenda</a>
            by working with it in tandem, and displaying the progress being made towards different commitments.

            <a href='https://citieswithnature.org/how-do-cities-contribute-to-global-nature-goals-and-targets/' target='blank'>
            CitiesWithNature Action Platform</a> where cities can showcase their actions and plans, understand
            how they contribute to global
            nature goals and easily track their achievements. The Area-based Commitments platform has been
            designed with common fields that relate to various UNEP-WCMC platforms.
            This platform tracks the commitments to area-based measures, and the
            <a href='https://www.protectedplanet.net/en' target='blank'>Protected Planet Initiative</a>
            (underpinned by the World Database on Protected Areas and other databases) to track the area-based measures
            that have been implemented. The site is designed such that when relevant area-based commitments are eventually
            implemented, the information can seamlessly be transferred to the Protected Planet Initiative.
