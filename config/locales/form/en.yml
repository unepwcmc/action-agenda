      description: Form 1 will help establish whether this platform is the right place for your commitment. ‘Commitment’ refers to what you intend to do, for example, commitments to enhance/improve an existing area where new actions are planned or to establish a new area. ‘Area’ refers to the geographical area this is (or will be) under management as a result of this commitment.
      q1: 
        title: Does/will the area have a clearly-defined boundary?
        t: Yes - the area has, or will have, a clearly defined boundary
        f: No - the area does not and will not have a clearly defined boundary
        popupdescription_html: Note that the boundary does not need to be a physical barrier/visible on the ground.

          <a href='https://www.cbd.int/' target="_blank">three main goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity:</a> 
          conservation of biodiversity; sustainable use of biodiversity; and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising 
          from the use of genetic resources (e.g. plants and animals). The last objective may include monetary or non-monetary benefits. 
          The overall objective of this international treaty is to encourage actions which lead to a sustainable future.

          This should be the group(s) that decide to make the commitment, decide on the objectives of the commitment, 
          and decide on the actions taken to achieve those objectives.</br></br>
          ‘Collaborative governance’ means one group makes the decisions, but these decisions are made after consultation with other groups.</br></br> 
          ‘Joint governance’ means two or more groups make the decisions together.

          This page asks for details about commitment actions.
          
          A ‘commitment' is the pledge to conduct activities (which serve objectives related to the conservation and/or 
          sustainable use of nature), now or in the future, within a specific area. This might include establishing a new 
          protected area or improving the management/stewardship/governance of an existing area. 

          ‘Commitment actions’ are the actions that are taken to achieve objectives.

          ‘Area’ refers to the geographical area in which commitment activities take place. 
        q1:

          description: (Optional field)
          popupdescription_html: 
            The spatial data should be the geographical boundary of the area once the commitment has been implemented. 
            For example, if your commitment is to expand an existing area, please provide the boundary as it will be once the expansion is complete.

          caption: -Select-
          popupdescription_html:

          popupdescription_html:
            Stage of the commitment. Is it a future commitment or has it already been implemented? 
            Most commitments will be added to the platform at the 'committed' or 'in progress' stage, 
            but data-providers will be encouraged to update the status of their commitment to 'implemented' when appropriate.
        q2:

            If commitment actions started in the past they must still be in progress now.
        q4:
          title: What are the main threats that your commitment is seeking to address?
